The error indicates that the code is calling request.headers.set in the defaultInterceptor, but headers in the mockRequest is being treated as a plain object, which does not have a set method (this method is available in AxiosHeaders instances).

To resolve this issue, you can mock the headers object as an instance of AxiosHeaders or ensure that the set method is mocked. Here's how to fix it:


---

Solution 1: Use a Mocked set Method

Modify the test case to mock the set method:

test("axios.interceptors.request.use modifies request headers correctly", async () => {
  await defaultInterceptor("EN"); // Call the interceptor to set up the request interceptor

  // Get the request interceptor function
  const interceptorFn = (axios.interceptors.request.use as jest.Mock).mock.calls[0][0];
  const mockRequest = { 
    url: "/test-endpoint", 
    headers: { 
      set: jest.fn(), // Mock the `set` method
    }, 
  }; // Simulated request object

  await interceptorFn(mockRequest); // Call the interceptor logic

  // Verify that headers.set is called with the correct arguments
  expect(mockRequest.headers.set).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8",
  });
});

Solution 2: Mock AxiosHeaders Properly

Mock headers as an instance of AxiosHeaders, which includes the set method:

import { AxiosHeaders } from "axios";

test("axios.interceptors.request.use modifies request headers correctly", async () => {
  await defaultInterceptor("EN"); // Call the interceptor to set up the request interceptor

  // Get the request interceptor function
  const interceptorFn = (axios.interceptors.request.use as jest.Mock).mock.calls[0][0];
  const mockHeaders = new AxiosHeaders(); // Simulated headers object
  jest.spyOn(mockHeaders, "set"); // Spy on the `set` method

  const mockRequest = { 
    url: "/test-endpoint", 
    headers: mockHeaders, 
  }; // Simulated request object

  const modifiedRequest = await interceptorFn(mockRequest); // Call the interceptor logic

  // Verify that headers.set is called with the correct arguments
  expect(mockHeaders.set).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8",
  });

  // Ensure modifiedRequest includes the mock headers
  expect(modifiedRequest.headers).toBe(mockHeaders);
});

Key Changes

1. Mocking set Method:

Added set: jest.fn() in mockRequest.headers to prevent the TypeError.



2. Using AxiosHeaders:

Created a new instance of AxiosHeaders for mockHeaders.

Spied on the set method to verify calls.

Why This Works

By mocking the set method or using AxiosHeaders, the interceptor logic can run without errors.

The test validates that the set method is called correctly and ensures the test coverage is accurate.
